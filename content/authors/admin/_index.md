#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Howdy!
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, focusing on the intersection of generative AI and materials science. My research employs cutting-edge techniques in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) to advance material design and discovery. Additionally, I have served as a reviewer for prestigious conferences, including ICLR, KDD, and DSAA. I hold an M.Sc. in Physics from Boğaziçi University and a B.Sc. in Physics Engineering from Hacettepe University.

Beyond my academic career, I have been professionally active since 2019, successfully leading projects across diverse industries, including media, defense, and consumer electronics. In these roles, I deployed state-of-the-art machine learning models and computational imaging systems to solve complex, real-world problems effectively.
